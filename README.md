## Introduction
The Bike Sharing Dataset contains information about daily bike rentals in a city, including weather conditions and other factors. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights and patterns in the data that can help understand the factors influencing bike rentals.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
In this section, we load the dataset, preprocess the data by converting the 'dteday' column to datetime format, and display the first few rows of the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Here, we perform various exploratory data analyses, including:
- Summary Statistics
- Data Distribution
- Temporal Analysis
- Seasonal Analysis
- Daily Analysis
- Monthly Analysis
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot Analysis

## Modeling and Predictions
We build a simple linear regression model to predict bike rentals based on weather conditions. We evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

## Conclusion
This section summarizes the key findings of the analysis and suggests further steps for improving the predictive performance of the model.
